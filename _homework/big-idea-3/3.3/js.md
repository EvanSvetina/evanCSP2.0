# Basic Algebraic Math hacks

## Q1 (Exponents):
### A cube has a side length of 6 units. What is its volume?


```python
%%js
let sideLength = 6;
let volumeCube = sideLength*sideLength*sideLength;

console.log("the volume of the cube is " + volumeCube + ".");
```

## Q2 (PEMDAS):
### Evaluate the expression: 

(7+14)*5/12 + 2


```python
%%js 
console.log ((7+14)*5/12 + 2);
```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


## Q3 (Algorithm): 

Write JavaScript  code where you define variables and run commands that find the values of operations you apply onto them


```python
%%js 
let plus = "+";
let minus = "-";
let times = "*";
let divide = "/";
let number1 = 6
let number2 = 7

console.log(number1 + plus + number2 + "=" + (number1 + number2)); //sum

console.log(number1 + minus + number2 + "=" + (number1 - number2)); //difference

console.log(number1 + times + number2 + "=" + (number1 * number2)); //product

console.log(number1 + divide + number2 + "=" + (number1 / number2)); //quotient
```
