# Basic Algebraic Math hacks

## Q1 (Exponents):
### A cube has a side length of 4 units. What is its volume?


```python
sidelength = 4
volumeCube = sidelength**3
print("the volume of the cube is " + str(volumeCube) + " units.")
```

    the volume of the cube is 64.


## Q2 (PEMDAS):
### Evaluate the expression: 

 (12+8)/2+(3^2)


```python
print( (12+8)/2+(3^2))
```

    11.0


## Q3 (Algorithm): 

Write Python  code where you define variables and run commands that find the values of operations you apply onto them


```python
plus = "+"
minus = "-"
times = "*"
divide = "/"
number1 = 6
number2 = 7

print(f"{number1}{plus}{number2}={number1 + number2}")      # sum
print(f"{number1}{minus}{number2}={number1 - number2}")     # difference
print(f"{number1}{times}{number2}={number1 * number2}")     # product
print(f"{number1}{divide}{number2}={number1 / number2}")    # quotient
```

    6+7=13
    6-7=-1
    6*7=42
    6/7=0.8571428571428571
